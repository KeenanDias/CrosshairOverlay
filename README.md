# Precision Crosshair Overlay

## Overview
This software provides a high-speed visual assistance layer for competitive gaming. It draws a custom aiming point over any active window or full-screen application. It is designed to help players maintain accuracy in games that do not provide a built-in crosshair or where the default aim point is hard to see. The program focuses on speed and minimal impact on system performance.

## Key Features
* **Universal Compatibility:** Works on top of windowed, borderless, and full-screen modes for most modern games.
* **Zero Latency:** The code is optimized to draw the overlay without slowing down your game or lowering your frame rate.
* **Custom Design:** Users can easily change the size, color, and thickness of the crosshair to match their preference.
* **Background Transparency:** The overlay removes all background elements so only the crosshair is visible.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release zip file.
2. Extract the contents to a folder on your computer.
3. Run the main executable file as an administrator to ensure it appears over game windows.

## Usage
Once the program is running, the crosshair will appear at the exact center of your primary monitor.

**Default Controls:**
* **Insert:** Show or hide the overlay.
* **Page Up:** Increase crosshair size.
* **Page Down:** Decrease crosshair size.
* **End:** Close the application.
